 Authenticate and Authorization using Passport
 Note: So in passport we install few packages:

1. passort
2.passport-local
3.passport-local-mongoose
4.mongoose (if not installed earlier)
5. express-session (if not installed earlier)

Steps:
1.we need to make some changes in the app.js file following code should be added after the view engine line
and before the logger line as follows

app.set('view engine', 'ejs');

--Session and Passport Code Started --
app.use(expressSession({
  resave:false,
  saveUninitialized:false,
  secret:'hello hello baye baye'
}))
app.use(passport.initialize());
app.use(passport.session());
app.use(passport.serializeUser(usersRouter.serializeUser()));
app.use(passport.deserializeUser(usersRouter.deserializeUser()));

--Session and Passport Code Ended --
app.use(logger('dev'));

In the above code we are using the express session to allow to create the session and after the we are preparing
to initialize the passport and after that we are using passort session wherein actual session for passport gets created .
Session means we allow to store data on backend side. 
serializeUser and deserializeUser -> You can consider them as the encryption and decryption of data ->It consists code which
is responsible for hashing the data (encryption and decryption).

Note:

passport-> Structure
passport-local-> Strategy(Heart)
passport-local-mongoose-> Allowing for handling the hashing of the data.
